## How to generate a word cloud from resume text
<br />
This word cloud generated is a snapshot of a text from a resume. Done to help you explore and understand focus words at a glance. It is a word image where each word's size is proportional to its occurrence throughout the resume text. The more the word appears in the resume the larger it is in the image.
